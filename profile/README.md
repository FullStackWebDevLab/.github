# FullStackWebDevLab

This is a personal organization dedicated to my journey in learning full stack web development.  
It will serve as a central space for both **notes** and **projects**, documenting my progress as I build skills from the fundamentals of web technologies to complete applications.  

The repositories here will include:  
- Notes on key concepts and technologies.  
- Practice projects that reinforce specific topics.  
- Larger full stack applications showcasing end-to-end development.  

The purpose of this organization is to provide structure to my learning while building a portfolio of work that reflects my growth as a developer.
